A rhythm tree (RT) is a list representing a rhythmic structure. This list is organized 
hierarchically in sub lists , just as time is organized in measures, time signatures, 
pulses and rhythmic elements in the traditional notation.

Hence, the expression form of rhythm trees is crucially different from that of onsets 
and offsets. It can be exacting and not very "ergonomic", from a musician's point of 
view : rhythm trees can be long, with a great number of parenthesis and sub lists nested 
within each others.

This module provides the syntactic and semantic principles that rule rhythm trees.

  A rhythm tree is a list representing a rhythmic structure. This list is organized 
  hierarchically in sub lists, just as time is organized in measures, time signatures, 
  pulses and rhythmic elements in the traditional notation.

  Traditionally, rhythm is broken up into several data : meter, measure(s) and duration(s). 
  Rhythm trees must enclose these information in lists and sub list.

  This elementary rhythm:
  
  [1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4] --> (four 1/4-notes in 4/4 time)
  
  can be expressed as follows :

    ( ? ( (4//4 (1 1 1 1) ) ) )
    
  A tree structure can be reduced to a list : (D (S)).
  
  
  >> Main Components : Duration and Subdivisions
  
    D = a duration , or number of measures : ( ? ) or a number ( n ).
    When D = ?, OM calculates the duration.
    By default, this duration is equal to 1.
  
    S = subdivisions (S) of this duration, that is a time signature and rhythmic proportions.
    Time signature = n // n   or ( n n ).
    It must be specified at each new measure, even if it remains unchanged.
    
    Rhythm = proportions : ( n n n n )
