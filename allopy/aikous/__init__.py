General psychoacoustic tools for working with music synthesis.

`Aikous` is a specialized module for working with psychoacoustics in the context of music.

see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics

The word "aikous" is a portmanteau derived from Ancient Greek, blending the elements of 
"αἰσθάνομαι" (aisthanomai), meaning "to perceive" or "to feel," and "ἀκούω" (akouo), 
meaning "to hear."

The `aikous` module contains tools for translating physics phenomena, as perceived by
humans, into algebraic musical representations.
